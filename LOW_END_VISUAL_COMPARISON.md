## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### The low-end version follows these principles:

1. **Minimalism is Professional**
   - Apple's website doesn't use Three.js everywhere
   - Stripe's landing page uses CSS gradients
   - GitHub uses simple, clean designs
   - **Professional ≠ Heavy animations**

2. **Smooth > Fancy**
   - A smooth gradient is more professional than laggy 3D
   - Users prefer responsive over impressive-but-slow
   - Fast sites = professional perception

3. **Your Content Shines**
   - When graphics are simpler, visitors focus on:
     - Your projects
     - Your skills
     - Your achievements
   - Background should support, not distract

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Companies Using Simple Backgrounds Successfully:

1. **Vercel** - Gradient mesh backgrounds (no Three.js on mobile)
2. **Linear** - Subtle gradients with blur effects
3. **Framer** - CSS-based animated gradients

### What They DON'T Do:
- ❌ Force heavy 3D on mobile
- ❌ Lag on scroll
- ❌ Drain batteries
